**GastroJunkie**

A table booking application prototype developed for BrewPubs, Eco Bars, Dine-Ins, Take Aways which covers the requirements. 

**How To**

Every person has very specific demands to book a table in the restaurant. Further, there are wait times at major restaurants. The application prototype allows the user to select a restaurant, set a timer, feed his or her email and phone number and compare tables on multiple criteria. This app can be opened with MIT app inventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu/). Please go to Projects and "Import Project (.aia) from my computer". Screen 1 includes a Video Player which needs to capture the look and feel of the restaurant via videos.

**Credits**

This application was developed by Neeraj and myself (Ramkumar) over multiple nightouts as well as surveying the clientele of Bangaluru restaurants. The only investment was a big flask of coffee. There is no logo to the application. We were both full time employees of other organizations and this was done during non working hours.

**Future**

In 2020, we may need to add Covid-19 compliant to one of the parameters. We may also need to add availability of hand sanitizers. We cpuld also add things like Open Kitchens, Non over packaging, Uniformed Personnel, Security Guard Availability, Closed Captioning of TV, IoT enabled lighting and Permission for concealed weaponry 

**AIA**

AIA is a format supported by App Inventor. It is just a ZIP file. It can be opened with 7-Zip.

**Logos**

The logos checked in were done by a Professional Organization for fees. We planned to make night light laser keychains with the same if we had the budget.
